This is a simple web app I created with flask. It has a few functionalities
- signup and login features, so that you have to sign in to use parts of the site. 
- SQLAlchemy database - stores login information and any notes/photos that you upload
- Displays the Notes and photos that you upload
- Hyperlinks
- Forms
- I learned flask, HTML, Jinja2, and a bit of SQLAlchemy to do this project. 

- In terms of next steps, I hope to host this using a performance environment host, and turn it into a website that rates the top dishes in your neighborhood rather than the top restaurants!
